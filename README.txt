This module, developed for TechMission's UrbanMinistry.org by Evan Donovan, for use within the Find Your Calling Facebook application is clearly a proof of concept, and would have to be heavily adapted either to be used on your own site, or else to be made generic.

Still, it is being released as a demonstration of how Quicktabs and some hook_block() trickery can be used to load content dynamically on your site.

The module's code is licensed under the GPL.
